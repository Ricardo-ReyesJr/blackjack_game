# blackjack_game

This is a learning project, this is a text-based game that I started working on when I first started my in to my Bachelors degree in Computer Science. This project is incomplete. It's possible that most of the code is missing through out all the iterations and changes I have done to it. Hopefully and maybe some day i might come back to it and finish. This project is Done in Python. Which was the first language we learned for programming.
