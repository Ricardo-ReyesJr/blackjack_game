# blackjack_game

This is a learning project, this is a text-based game that I started working on when I first started my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. This project is incomplete. It's possible that most of the code is missing throughout all the iterations and changes I have done to it. Hopefully and maybe someday I might come back to it and finish. This project is Done in Python. Which was the first language we learned for programming. As for now this project will remain incomplete.
